v4.0.0
-----

**WARNING: Please read carefully through the stated changes, as they probably will break your current setup and can result in duplicate postgresql versions being installed, configuration corruption and data loss! This list might not be complete, so be careful when using the 4.x version and make sure to test it extensively before production use!**

When in doubt, put the following in your `Berksfile` until you are ready to upgrade:

```ruby
cookbook 'postgresql', '=~ 3.4.0'
```

* Potential breaking change: Restructured default attributes to avoid compile time deriving other attribute values from value of the `node[‘postgresql’][‘version’]`
(#313, #302, #295, #288, #280, #261, #260, #254, #248, #217, #214, #167, #143). If you specify a custom postgresql version, make sure to adapt the following attributes as well:

```ruby
default['postgresql']['dir'] = "/etc/postgresql/#{node['postgresql']['version']}/main"
default['postgresql']['client']['packages'] = [ "postgresql-client-#{node['postgresql']['version']}", 'libpq-dev' ]
default['postgresql']['server']['packages'] = [ "postgresql-#{node['postgresql']['version']}" ]
default['postgresql']['contrib']['packages'] = [ "postgresql-contrib-#{node['postgresql']['version']}" ]
```

* Potential breaking change: SSL configuration parameters. Due to the new structuring, make sure you set all SSL attributes to `override` when specifying them in a cookbook:

```ruby
override['postgresql']['config']['ssl'] = true
override['postgresql']['config']['ssl_cert_file'] = "/path/to/cert.crt"
override['postgresql']['config']['ssl_key_file']  = "/path/to/cert.key"
override['postgresql']['config']['ssl_ciphers']  = "<my cipher suite>"
```

* Potential breaking change: Some node attributes are now persistet in your node configuration. This affects the following attributes:

```json
"config": {
  "data_directory": "/var/lib/postgresql/9.4/main",
  "hba_file": "/etc/postgresql/9.4/main/pg_hba.conf",
  "ident_file": "/etc/postgresql/9.4/main/pg_ident.conf",
  "external_pid_file": "/var/run/postgresql/9.4-main.pid",
  "unix_socket_directories": "/var/run/postgresql",
  "ssl_cert_file": "/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem",
  "ssl_key_file": "/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key"
}
```

* Potential breaking change: Parsing of attributes from node/ environment configuration. It has been reported that setting the `node['postgresql']['client']['packages']` attribute in a cookbook might result in the default version of the postgresql client package being installed alongside the required version. This might affect the server packages as well.
* Correct issues which caused the inability to override installation version defaults
* Correct issues which caused configuration file entries with miss matching version numbers and incorrect file system paths being defined
* Remove method pgdgrepo_rpm_info compile time use of derived attributes case many issues
* Use correct directory path and check for the correct not_if condition to determine if the database has been initialized
* Ensure that correct packages are installed in all scenarios where pg gem is compiled
* Fix errors in configuration files for unix_socket_directory and unix_socket_directories
* Updates to test-kitchen suite configuration
* Added more grey hair to my beard

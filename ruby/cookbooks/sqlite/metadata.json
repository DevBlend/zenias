We have decided to deprecate it, so we can focus our effort on complex cookbooks that provide more value to the overall Chef community. If you have thoughts on how this cookbook could be redesigned to provide more value to the community please reach out to us at cookbooks@chef.io.\n\n## Requirements\n### Platforms\n- Debian/Ubuntu\n- RHEL/CentOS/Scientific/Amazon/Oracle\n\n### Chef\n- Chef 11+\n\n### Cookbooks\n- none\n\n## Usage\nIf you want to store data on a local sql database in a single file, use sqlite, and include `recipe[sqlite]`.\n\n## License & Authors\n**Author:** Cookbook Engineering Team ([cookbooks@chef.io](mailto:cookbooks@chef.io))\n\n**Copyright:** 2008-2016, Chef Software, Inc.\n\n```\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Chef Software, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@chef.io","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0","amazon":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{"sqlite::default":"Installs sqlite"}}
